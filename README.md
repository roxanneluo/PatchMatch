Description: This project is a personal implementation of an algorithm called PATCHMATCH that restores missing areas in an image. 
The algorithm is presented in the following paper 
 PatchMatch  A Randomized Correspondence Algorithm          
               for Structural Image Editing                       
   by C.Barnes,E.Shechtman,A.Finkelstein and Dan B.Goldman

# Requirements 

To run the project you need to install Opencv library and link it to your project. 
Opencv can be download it here 
http://opencv.org/downloads.html

To compile with opencv, add to `~/.bash_profile` (mac)
```
export CPATH="$OPENCV_INCLUDE_DIR:$CPATH"
export LIBRARY_PATH=$OPENCV_LIBRARY_DIR:$LIBRARY_PATH
```

# How to use 
## Demo
To run demo,
```
make
build/patchmatch.out
```

## Change Image Path
The project accepts two images 
1- The original image 
2- The pruned image you can delete a part of interest in the image. The algorithm will patch the remaining image to give a natural result. 

The project contains some example of images to try it. You may find them in image_files. 
After choosing the image file, enter the paths of those image files in main.c 

char fileNameInput[50] = YOUR_PATH_HERE_OF_ORIGINAL_IMAGE;
char fileNameMasked[50] = YOUR_PATH_HERE_OF_PRUNED_IMAGE;


Enjoy!!
